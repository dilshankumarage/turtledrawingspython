ðŸŽ¨ Python Turtle Art Projects
This repository contains three creative Python projects built using the Turtle graphics module. Each program demonstrates how fundamental programming concepts can be used to generate visually engaging art through code.

ðŸ§  Projects Included
1. Random Walk Generator
Simulates a turtle taking random steps in 4 cardinal directions. With each step, the turtle changes color and draws a line with increasing brush thickness, creating a colorful, abstract path.

2. Spirograph Drawer
Draws a symmetrical and mesmerizing spirograph by repeatedly rotating the turtle and drawing circles in varying colors. A perfect example of how mathematics and art intersect through code.

3. Hirst Dot Painting (20x20 Grid)
Inspired by Damien Hirst's dot artwork. This script extracts dominant colors from an image using the colorgram library and generates a 20Ã—20 grid of colored dots, using those colors randomly to simulate a pointillist painting.

ðŸ”§ Key Concepts Practiced
Object-Oriented Programming with Turtle

Modular function design

Loops and conditionals

Randomization using random

RGB color handling with turtle.colormode(255)

Extracting color palettes using colorgram

Turtle movement and positioning (penup, goto, setheading)

ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Python 3.x

turtle (standard library)

colorgram.py (install via pip install colorgram.py)

An image file (.jpg or .png) for the Hirst painting script

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository

Run each Python file (.py) individually depending on the project

Close the turtle screen window to exit the program
